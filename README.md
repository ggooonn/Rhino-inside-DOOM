# Rhino-inside-DOOM
> **"Yes... Rhino can run DOOM."**

**Rhino-inside-DOOM** is a proof-of-concept project that implements a DOOM-style raycasting engine directly within the **Rhino 3D** viewport using **Grasshopper** and **Python**.

This is not just a game; it is a computational design study on how to port spatial logic and rendering algorithms into an architectural modeling environment.

---

Concept
A proof-of-concept project implementing a Raycasting Engine directly inside Rhino 3D & Grasshopper using pure Python. No external game engines, just pure geometry logic.

Features
Core Logic: Raycasting algorithm implemented in Python script.

Display: Dynamic mesh generation in Rhino Viewport.

Control: Real-time navigation via ctypes (WASD support).

How to Run
Open Rhino_Doom.gh in Grasshopper.

Set Boolean Toggle to True.

Rip and Tear. (Move with WASD)
